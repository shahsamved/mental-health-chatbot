       "[' What is a panic attack? Panic attacks come on suddenly and involve intense and often overwhelming fear. They’re accompanied by very challenging physical symptoms, like a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, or nausea. Unexpected panic attacks occur without an obvious cause. Expected panic attacks are cued by external stressors, like phobias. Panic attacks can happen to anyone, but having more than one may be a sign of panic disorder, a mental health condition characterized by sudden and repeated panic attacks.',\n",
       " ' What are symptoms of panic attack vs. anxiety attack? Panic and anxiety attacks may feel similar, and they share a lot of emotional and physical symptoms. You can experience both an anxiety and a panic attack at the same time. For instance, you might experience anxiety while worrying about a potentially stressful situation, like an important presentation at work. When the situation arrives, anxiety may culminate in a panic attack.\\n\\nA panic attack or anxiety attack can both cause physical and emotional symptoms, including:\\n- apprehension and worry\\n- distress\\n- fear of dying or losing control\\n- a sense of detachment from the world (derealization) or oneself (depersonalization)\\n- heart palpitations or an accelerated heart rate\\n- chest pain\\n- shortness of breath\\n- tightness in the throat or feeling like you’re choking\\n- dry mouth\\n- sweating\\n- chills or hot flashes\\n- trembling or shaking\\n- numbness or tingling (paresthesia)\\n- nausea, abdominal pain, or upset stomach\\n- headache\\n- feeling faint or dizzy',\n",

The more common types include:\\n\\nAnxiety disorders: People with anxiety disorders respond to certain objects or situations with fear and dread, as well as with physical signs of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating. An anxiety disorder is diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal functioning. \\nMood disorders: These disorders, also called affective disorders, involve persistent feelings of sadness or periods of feeling overly happy, or fluctuations from extreme happiness to extreme sadness.\\nPsychotic disorders: Psychotic disorders involve distorted awareness and thinking. Two of the most common symptoms of psychotic disorders are hallucinations and delusions. Schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder.\\nEating disorders: Eating disorders involve extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors involving weight and food. \\nPersonality disorders: People with personality disorders have extreme and inflexible personality traits that are distressing to the person and/or cause problems in work, school, or social relationships.\\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): People with OCD are plagued by constant thoughts or fears that cause them to perform certain rituals or routines. An example is a person with an unreasonable fear of germs who constantly washes their hands.\\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): PTSD is a condition that can develop following a traumatic and/or terrifying event, such as a sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, or a natural disaster.\",\n",

       " ' How can you treat mental illness? As these illnesses are biologically based brain disorders, a regimen of medication and therapy is needed. There is a misconception that mental illnesses such as depression, OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) can be “snapped out of” or “overcome by willpower”, which is false and breeds a hostile atmosphere. Treatment incudes 3 main facets: medication, therapy & support. There are several types of medication being produced to combat mental-illness, the aim of which is to reduce social symptoms and help bring about daily functioning. Therapy with a clinically trained psychologist helps understand your disease better and equips you with the tools you need to deal with the disease. Support of family, friends & community helps the patient feel less isolated & gives them a platform for open communication. Feeling like a part of a community helps the patient ground themselves',\n",

Talk it out: Find a mental health professional and start talking about your day to day life. Talking it out helps reduce the mental worry one carries with them. Talking to a professional helps you understand your mechanisms and how to deal better with them.\\n2. Exercise: Be it the gym or just a run, doing a cardio activity leads to better stress levels\\n3. Meditation\\n4. Breathing exercises\\n5. Choose an activity of your liking\\n6. Write a journal',\n",

       " ' Is it normal for an older person living alone to be depressed? It is not normal for an older person living alone, retired, or away from his/her children to feel depressed. In fact, depression in elderly people can often go untreated because many people think that depression is a normal part of aging and a natural reaction to chronic illness, loss and retirement.  Many elderly people and their families also do not recognize the symptoms of depression so it can go unnoticed. According to studies done by IDRAAC, 8.6% of Lebanese older adults are depressed and females are twice more likely to develop depression than males.',\n",

Mental illness is generally a lifelong, chronic medical illness that needs consistent treatment.',\n",
       " ' Can people stabilize a mental illness simply with medication alone? Though medications can often aid in the treatment of mental illness, it is unlikely that taking medication as the sole form of treatment will be effective in \"getting over\" or stabilizing one\\'s mental illness.

       " \" Why does someone with mental illness need to have a routine? Mental illness can often disrupt a person's life by hindering that person's ability to focus on and complete tasks that they otherwise would be able to complete. Establishing a productive daily routine can help to normalize that person's daily life and having a routine most often contributes to increased life satisfaction that comes with personal accomplishment (in the human population as a whole, not just those living with mental illness).\",\n",
       " ' Why do some people choose to just take meds and no therapy, is that safe? The decision to take prescription medication is one that every individual must make for his or herself. Some people do not feel comfortable divulging information to doctors or others living with mental illness in a therapy environment so they choose to rely solely on medication to combat the disturbances in their lives caused by mental illness. The question of whether it is safe to take prescription medication without partaking in therapy can best be answered by stating that it might be less effective to take medication without the benefit of therapy, but it does not seem to have been proven to be unsafe.',\n",
       " ' Does exercising help control mental illness just by itself? By itself, exercise is unlikely to control many types of mental illness. Many health care professionals think that physical exercise has a positive effect on depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses, though all caution that more clinical research must be done on the subject. There does seem to be a large section of the medical community that believes physical exercise, in conjunction with therapy and prescription medication, is very beneficial to persons living with mental illnesses, as it is for all people.',\n",
       " \" Are there any ethnic/racial groups that more likely to have mental illnesses? The types of mental illness and the percentage of the population with each illness is the same across cultures. Cultures vary in how mental illness is stigmatized, beliefs about the cause of mental illness, and response to different treatments. Mental Health professionals from many different fields differ in their opinions on this and related questions. One argument is that people with lower economic and social status (not ethnicity) are possibly more likely to develop mental illness due to the barriers to advancement implicit in those groups' social stature.\",\n",
       " ' How does someone acquire a mental illness? Scientists are still studying how people become mentally ill, so we do not know as much as we would like about how a person develops a mental disorder.

First, insurance companies often restrict benefits available to individuals with mental illness by placing greater limits on their use (i.e. by restricting the annual amount of inpatient and outpatient services covered) or by imposing greater cost sharing than for other medical needs. Second, many insurance companies refuse to cover illnesses or conditions they believe to be preexisting. Simply put, if you have had a diagnosed mental illness for many years, securing insurance could be difficult or very costly.

A “Brand” name medication has a patent that allows the manufacturer exclusive rights to sell the medication for a certain number of years. “Brand” name drugs cost more because the pharmaceutical company discovering the drug is attempting to recover the hundreds of millions of dollars it took to do the research to make sure the drug is safe and effective. Other costs involved with brand-name medications include manufacturing, distributing, and advertising. When the patent time for a brand-name medication runs out other manufacturers are allowed to make and sell “Generic” versions of the same drug. The active ingredient(s) of \"Generic\" medications are identical to the “Brand” ingredient(s) though the tablet or capsule may look slightly different in color, shape, etc., and generally is less costly.

Medications for mental illness are generally safe and effective when used as prescribed.   As with any medication, however, side effects may occur. Research shows that medications like antipsychotics, lithium and antidepressants can actually protect brain cells from damage caused by brain illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  This improves overall functioning. While this is true, consumers should know that every medication has some risk of long-term adverse effects.  For example, clozapine poses a risk of lowering immune system function, valproate has a risk of causing liver injury and lithium has a risk of decreasing kidney function.  It is a good idea for consumers to be aware of the possible long term adverse effects of each medication prescribed for them. Regular visits to your doctor and blood tests are often necessary to screen for and prevent these adverse effects.',\n",

One answer is to let the person with mental illness know that he can always count on your love and friendship, but their best chances of improvement will occur when they accept that medication is crucial to their recovery. Sometimes one can help persons struggling with mental illness (especially bipolar disorder or schizophrenia) decide for themselves which is worse – the short periods of time without the medication and side effects, followed by the inevitable resurgence of the illness (often times with worse symptoms than before).....or, the steadier, prolonged times of symptom-free living (or at least more manageable symptoms) while taking the medications, and coping with the side effects?

These symptoms generally appear within days of stopping an antidepressant and can last up to two weeks. If the antidepressant is restarted, the discontinuation symptoms are quickly eliminated.\\nIn order to avoid withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping these drugs, the dosages are often reduced gradually by your health care provider. Therefore, you should never abruptly stop taking your antidepressant medication. You should always consult your doctor or pharmacist before discontinuing any medication.

       " \" How to Use Yoga to Improve Your Mental Health? The best way to learn yoga is with a qualified teacher, either in a private session or in a group. A yoga teacher can correct your poses and show you how to modify them if necessary. You can use blocks, straps, and other items to make some poses easier. You can even do yoga in a chair instead of on the floor. \\n\\nIt's also possible to learn yoga online or from a book or DVD. But the best way to avoid injury is to take an in-person yoga class. Once you have the basics down, you can use books and videos to help you practice. You will benefit more from yoga if you do it at home between classes, and online classes can keep your home practice interesting. If you are comfortable doing yoga at home, you can practice when you experience extra stress, sleeplessness, or other challenges.\",\n",

       " ' What About Depression Later In Life? For older adults who experience depression for the first time later in life, other factors, such as changes in the brain or body, may be at play. For example, older adults may suffer from restricted blood flow, a condition called ischemia. Over time, blood vessels become less flexible. They may harden and prevent blood from flowing normally to the body’s organs, including the brain. If this occurs, an older adult with no family or personal history of depression may develop what some doctors call “vascular depression.” Those with vascular depression also may be at risk for a coexisting cardiovascular illness, such as heart disease or a stroke.',\n",

       " ' How Can Treatment-Resistant Depression Be Treated? Treatment of resistant depression has most commonly been treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT has been modified to avoid the pain previously associated with it and is the most effective and quick-acting treatment for resistant depression. The downside is that it works by inducing brain seizures and can impair memory. Its therapeutic benefits can also fade over time. New methods of brain stimulation also offer the possibility of relief. These technologies exploit the fact that the brain is an electrical organ: it responds to electrical and magnetic stimulation to modulate brain circuits and change brain activity.',\n",

There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer).
